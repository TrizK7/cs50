Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With 10 simulations, you can see how the time gets bigger and comparing de 2018 and 2019 you can see a clear difference

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 20 simulations.
