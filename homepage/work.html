        <h1>How i started</h1>
        <p>All started 4 years ago when i got really curious on how the things worked inside the computer,actually I've always had this curiosity, sometimes I literally opened things up to find out how they worked, I kept causing problems, but over time I ended up losing interest and decided that I would do something else, I tried to get into architecture school haha, I couldn't luckily, so i decided to study about the thing that has always been my interest in computing, and it was my best choice.<br><br>When I started college I wasn't in my best mental condition, a lot of things happened that shook me a lot, as we were in a pandemic all my classes were online and exams too, so I didn't really care. however last year I decided to change, I decided that I would take care of myself and improve, but I didn't make much progress in college or much less in my skills, from July to here I've been studying and practicing, and that's when I decided that I would participate only cs50 , I admit that it was difficult, many things that I had no idea existed, and things that I had a basis for but not enough.<br><br>But gladly, this course and the research I did abroad helped me a lot to progress, and I recommend this course to everyone with the same interest.</p>
